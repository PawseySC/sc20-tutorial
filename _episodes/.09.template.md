### Title (header 3 for size reasons)

#### Subtitle

##### subsubtitle...and so on


Text types: **bold**, *italic*, ***bold+italic***, `code monospace`.

How to add a new line in same paragraph.  
Add two spaces at end of line, then newline.

Leave an entire blank line for a new paragraph.

```
code block
```

* itemise

1. enumerate

> cite

I recommend HTML to embed images, so it's customisable:

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/pawsey.jpeg" alt="Pawsey Logo" width="250">

For comments in the markdown source, go again the HTML way with `<!--` and `-->`.
<!-- This is just a comment -->


### Carpentry style: special syntax

When embedding images or links to files in this repo, you need syntax like in the image example above: `{{ page.root }}/fig/pawsey.jpeg`.  
The *page.root* sugar ensures the file is found at the time the HTML page is created.

Coloured side for code blocks:

```
# This is bash
```
{: .bash}

After the closing triple ticks, add one of these: `{: .bash}`, `{: .source}`, `{: .output}`, `{: .error}`.  There's similar sugar for python, r, sql, make and matlab.  
I normally use *bash* for shell commands, *source* for scripts, and *output*/*error* as appropriate.

{: .callout}


> ## Challenge

> Do you know this?

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


There are other specials blocks that I normally don't use, in particular `discussion` and `checklist`.
